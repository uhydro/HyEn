# Hydrological Engineering
In this repository, the results of the Hydrological Engineering course of summer 2025 are stored. This servers as a toolbox for Ecohydrological Engineering modules and packages. These packages are open source and have been prepared by students of the Water Engineering Master and of the Master of Applied Ecohydrology at TH Lübeck.
## Precipitation Analysis with Python
The analysis of precipitation data can be carried out using the Standard Precipitation Index (SPI) as an index e.g. for identifying droughts. The methodology is described in [NCAR's Climate Data Guide] (https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu/climate-data/standardized-precipitation-evapotranspiration-index-spei). Lloyd‐Hughes, Benjamin, and Mark A. Saunders. "A drought climatology for Europe." International journal of climatology 22.13 (2002): 1571-1592 describe the application for Europe. Although several distributions are available, the Gamma distribution is suggested as a default distribution in the SPI function. The implementation allows for the user to fit precipitation data with L-moments or Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). In addition, it also allows for the fitting of daily, weekly, monthly or any custom time frame of SPI data. The package is compatible with Python 3. A case study of the application for Lübeck by Jeffrey Hamby is shown demonstrating the development of high drought indices for longer time periods.

## Ecohydrology of Rivers and Lakes
In this directory tools for the management of rivers and lakes and for the predicition of water quality in rivers and lakes are contained. This directory contains a Streeter Phelps model, a 1D advection dispersio model and and a 2D advection dispersion model for the dispersion from point sources as well as a temperature module for lakes.
