# Hydrological Engineering
In this repository, the results of the Hydrological Engineering course of summer 2025 are stored. This servers as a toolbox for Ecohydrological Engineering modules and packages. These packages are open source and have been prepared by students of the Water Engineering Master and of the Master of Applied Ecohydrology at TH LÃ¼beck.
## Precipitation Analysis with Python
## Analysing Evaporation with Python
## Infiltration and Soil Physics Models
## Flood Routing
## Hydrological modeling
## Groundwater modeling packages
## Wetland delineation
## Ecohydrology of Rivers and Lakes
In this directory tools for the management of rivers and lakes and for the predicition of water quality in rivers and lakes are contained. This directory contains a Streeter Phelps model, a 1D advection dispersio model and and a 2D advection dispersion model for the dispersion from point sources as well as a temperature module for lakes.
